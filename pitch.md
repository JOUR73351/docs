# Pitch Assignment

First pitch due **Wednesday Feb. 26**.

This class will have four projects, and you will need to submit a pitch for each one. The requirements of each project are flexible. The goal of these projects are to create something publishable, something you can use as a clip in your portfolio. Here are some guidelines for your projects.

- The project is an original piece of journalism.
- The project is based on findings from your own data analysis.
- The project should involve learning new skills that might not be covered in class.
- The project must be published online through GitHub.

### Pitch Requirements

1. A summary of your idea or hypothesis, which explains why it is newsworthy. This can be written as a nutgraf.
2. Links to data sources, or link to a spreadsheet with the data if you've already collected it.
3. Links to potential human sources. For your final project, you must do some additional reporting and talk to at least one source based on your data analysis.
4. Example(s) of a publication you could pitch your idea or project to and why.

### Submitting your pitch

1. In your Desktop, or where you keep your projects, create a folder for this class by typing in `mkdir data-journalism`, then `cd data-journalism`.
2. Create a new folder for all your pitches by running `mkdir pitches` and `cd pitches`.
3. Create a new Markdown file for your pitch by running `touch pitch1.md` and open your pitches folder by running `code .`.
   Here is a useful [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) on how to use Markdown. [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) is a useful tool for previewing and saving your Markdown files.
4. When you are done with your pitch, upload it to Github with the following steps.

   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository called `pitches`. Follow the prompts after you create the new repository.

   ```
   git init
   git add -A
   git commit -m "your commit message here"
   git remote add origin git@github.com:<YOUR USERNAME HERE>/pitches.git
   git push
   ```
